# Decisions

- **2026-10-30 — Record: an independent product.** The owner, in chat:
  "Please make sure that process-rules is an independent product and [the
  first client] is its first client about which the product shouldn't know.
  If you need to re-slice then re-slice." The product is built and released
  here and proven against a sandbox client; clients adopt a released version
  and track their own adoption. Code, tests and docs here name no client,
  this record included.
- **2026-10-30 — Record: machine setup is per agent account.** A first
  `machine` run asked for a token limited to one client repository and made
  its test commit there; the token then waited on an organisation owner's
  approval that the instructions only hinted at. Whether the agent can push,
  and the Verified test commit, depend on the client, so they move to
  `onboard`; `machine` sets up the agent account alone (P-02, P-04).
