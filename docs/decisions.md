# Decisions

- **2026-10-30 — Record: an independent product.** The owner, in chat:
  "Please make sure that process-rules is an independent product and [the
  first client] is its first client about which the product shouldn't know.
  If you need to re-slice then re-slice." The product is built and released
  here and proven against a sandbox client; clients adopt a released version
  and track their own adoption. Code, tests and docs here name no client,
  this record included.
- **2026-10-30 — Record: machine setup is per agent account.** A first
  `machine` run asked for a token limited to one client repository and made
  its test commit there; the token then waited on an organisation owner's
  approval that the instructions only hinted at. Whether the agent can push,
  and the Verified test commit, depend on the client, so they move to
  `onboard`; `machine` sets up the agent account alone (P-02, P-04).
- **2026-10-30 — Record: the agent account uses one classic token.** The
  owner, in chat: "Yes, classic token". A fine-grained token waits on each
  organisation owner's approval, reaches no repository where the agent is
  only an outside collaborator, takes one token per organisation, and, when
  an organisation owns it, cannot register the agent's signing key. A
  classic token with `repo`, `workflow`, `read:org`, `project` and
  `write:ssh_signing_key` reaches every repository the agent is invited to.
  What a leak could reach is bounded by inviting the dedicated agent account
  to client repositories only, and by an expiry: `machine` refuses a token
  that never expires and recommends 90 days, and `doctor` warns 14 days
  before it ends. `machine` also refuses a fine-grained token or missing
  scopes; `onboard` names an organisation that requires SAML authorisation
  or blocks classic tokens (P-02, P-04).
- **2026-10-31 — Record: staged adoption, P-12.** The owner, in chat: "Yes,
  add P-12 first". The first client adopts one feature at a time, and
  `onboard` turned every feature on at once: its work rules would refuse
  every agent push and pull request before the client's work lives in
  issues. So a client's settings list the features it has turned on,
  `onboard` sets up only those and adds one more on request, the shared
  checks and the pre-push hook skip features that are off, and the
  Project's title is a setting. Settings that list no features keep every
  feature on, as before. Added to roadmap v1 as P-12, after P-11.
- **2026-10-31 — Record: P-13, onboard works out the accounts.** The owner,
  asked whether a third party should be able to run plain `process-rules
  onboard`: "Yes." `onboard` suggests the owner from the `gh` login and the
  agent from the accounts `machine` set up on the Mac, for the owner to
  confirm, and adds its hook to `.claude/settings.json` without rewriting the
  rest of the file.
- **2026-10-31 — Record: P-14, process-rules adopts itself.** The owner: "Yes,
  add P-14". The product's own work moves from these files to issues and a
  Project, and agent sessions on it work as the agent account, so the product
  is built under its own rules before its first client moves its work.
